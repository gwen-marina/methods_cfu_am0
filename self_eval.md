# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
Not super confident. I'm like almost half confident.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel comfortable writing simple methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
What exactly does an '!' do? That was one of the questions, but I didn't find an answer.
